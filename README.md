Awesome Custom Bash Profile
=================

Bunch of my dotfiles which I need on any system I go:D
Some Lite Some Full !
anyway BANKAI !



How To Use
----------
```
sudo wget https://github.com/UltraWalker/AwesomeCustomBashProfile/blob/master/.bash_profile -P ~/ && sudo vim .bashrc
```
```
if [ -f ~/.bash_ultrawalker ]; then
    . ~/.bash_ultrawalker
fi
```

~/.bashrc file maybe different based on your distro just remember
* .bashrc is included with all others like .bash_profile
* /etc/bash.bashrc is included with .bashrc so
* */etc/bash.bashrc > ~/.bashrc > ~/.bash_profile*
